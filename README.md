## Introduction

This React application is a weather service, that displays real weather data fetched from a custom-built weather data API built using Ruby on Rails. Users can define the location with the help of [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/), utilizing the search feature, and defining time period with two selectors. The user is then presented with a familiar forecast UI, together with data visualization tools in the form of a line plot and a table. It is also possible to interact with a specific day, being presented with an "hour by hour" interface with expanded metrics.

## Features

-   Fetch weather data for a specific location and time period.
-   Quickly understand the weather of the day with the help of the different icons (translated from WMO weather codes)
-  Gain insight into the evolution of temperature and precipitation
- Get extra details on the events of a specific day
